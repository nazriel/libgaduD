How to use
============

Include Gadu.d by putting:

import Gadu; 

in your D program

code your application according to http://toxygen.net/libgadu/doc/

Building on *nix
============

dmd ./yourprogram.d ./Gadu.d -I./ -L-lgadu

Important, when building on unix systems first you need to get original libgadu on your box.


Building on Windows
============

libgadu hasn't got official support for Windows platform, but building library is possible.
I've include libgadu.lib and libgadu.dll files to use on Windows.

dmd ./yourprogram.d ./Gadu.d -I./ -L./windows/libgadu.lib

Then you need include libgadu.dll with your yourprogram.exe
libgadu.lib is formated with OMF for dmd/dmc support.

Example program
============

In ./example directory I've included one example program. In order to build it you need to run on *nix
	make
or on Windows 
	./build.bat
